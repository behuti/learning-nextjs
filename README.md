## Overview of this repo

This is a repo where I'll put all my notes about the (Next.js course)[https://perficient.udemy.com/course/nextjs-react-the-complete-guide/].

## What is Next.js?

Ia a React Framework. It builds **Fullstack** react Apps, and it **simplifies** the process of building fullstack applications with React. This is useful to render React components in the server. Because using these features without a framework is tricky & typically not all you need.

- Route Setup & Handling
- Form submission
- Data Fetching
- Authentication
- And much more.

## Key features & Benefits of Next.js

- Fullstack Apps [NextJS blends frontend + backend (in the same project)]
- File-based Routing [Routes are configured via the filesystem(folders + files)]
- Server-side Rendering [By default, NextJS(pre-) renders all pages on the server]

# First App Notes

## NextJS Renders pages on the server

Serve-side(Backend) ==== [Page/HTML content rendered on the server and sent to the client] ====> Client-side(Frontend)

This doesn't happen with Vanilla React APP, If we inspect the page on a Vanilla React App, we are gonna see just an empty page and some script imports.

With NextJS, You build fullstack apps, you have code that runs on the client, and you have a lot of code that runs on the server.

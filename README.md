## What is Next.js?

Ia a React Framework. It builds **Fullstack** react Apps, and it **simplifies** the process of building fullstack applications with React. This is useful to render React components in the server. Because using these features without a framework is tricky & typically not all you need.

- Route Setup & Handling
- Form submission
- Data Fetching
- Authentication
- And much more.

## Key features & Benefits of Next.js

- Fullstack Apps [NextJS blends frontend + backend (in the same project)]
- File-based Routing [Routes are configured via the filesystem(folders + files)]
- Server-side Rendering [By default, NextJS(pre-) renders all pages on the server]
